    Some simple strategies for prevention include:
    immunizing children against childhood diseases, including measles, meningitis, rubella and mumps;
    immunizing adolescent girls and women of reproductive age against rubella before pregnancy;
    screening for and treating syphilis and other infections in pregnant women;
    improving antenatal and perinatal care, including promotion of safe childbirth;
    following healthy ear care practices;
    screening of children for otitis media, followed by appropriate medical or surgical interventions;
    avoiding the use of particular drugs which may be harmful to hearing, unless prescribed and monitored by a qualified physician;
    referring infants at high risk, such as those with a family history of deafness or those born with low birth weight, birth asphyxia, jaundice or meningitis, for early assessment of hearing, prompt diagnosis and appropriate management, as required;
    reducing exposure (both occupational and recreational) to loud sounds by raising awareness about the risks; developing and enforcing relevant legislation; and encouraging individuals to use personal protective devices such as earplugs and noise-cancelling earphones and headphones.
