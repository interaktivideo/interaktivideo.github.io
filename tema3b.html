        <h3>One plus one equals three</h3>
        <enable-quotebox e-type="quote">A common belief is that people with deafblindness live in a completely silent and dark world and that they are often born with deafblindness.</enable-quotebox>
        <p>The truth is most people with dual sensory impairments have a residual vision or hearing residue or both that they can utilize if provision is made for it.</p>
        <ul><li>People who have impaired vision will become dependent on hearing to receive and interpret sounds that can support visual impressions. </li>
            <li>Likewise people who are hard of hearing will depend on the information and support they receive through sight. </li>
            <li>When both the vision and hearing senses are impaired it means that the person cannot compensate by adopting another the other sense. One plus one equals three.</li></ul>
        <br>
        <p>When the difficulties are so severe that hearing cannot compensate for vision loss and hearing loss cannot be compensated for with vision, the term <strong>deafblindness</strong> is used.</p>

            <p>The program we work with students with sensory impairment , a dual sensory loss, deafblindness.  They have issues with
                hearing, they have issues with vision. This challenges is communication, it challenges the way they socialise, challenges
                the way they get information. <br><br>Once we had these students we tend be their partners and help them to learn how to communicate,
                help them facilitate the information that they receive from the environment and then help them to explore, to be able to learn
                what the world is like. <br><br>The dual sensory loss, that deafblindness really makes them to not understand how the world. They get
                information in fragmenting bits so it get to confuse them. They don´t know what´s happening. There is lot of information at
                once, so we tend  to structure that so they at least they get to understand what the world is like. So when it comes to know
                hands on work, they have to experience, they  have to explore. And then we continue giving communicating every time, this is
                what is happening. We also help them to anticipate what is next, what have we done, what is next. <br><br>So our kids here are happy,
                are lovely. We love working with them.</p>
