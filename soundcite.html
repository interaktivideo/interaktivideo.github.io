<h4>Audiogram</h4>
<p>The <strong> audiogram</strong> is a graph which gives a detailed description of your hearing ability. It describes which sounds can be heard and which sounds are missing. The results of the measured hearing  are characterized in a curve in the audiogram. The curve gives a visual representation of the hearing loss. An audiogram can give a picture of an individuals hearing, but it says nothing about how an individual utilizes auditory impressions. Two people with similar audiograms can have two very different experiences of hearing.</p>
