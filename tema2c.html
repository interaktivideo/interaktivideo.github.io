   <h2 class="h2">How to use a hearing aid</h2>

<p class="p">The hearing aid is a sophisticated audio amplifier which to some extent can compensate for hearing loss. Since hearing
    loss is individual, hearing aid must be adapted to each user. The hearings aid amplifiers not all sounds like a lot,
    but emphasizes the sounds that the user has difficulty perceiving. But the soundscape emanating from the hearing aid
    is not as clearly as the soundscape a person with normal hearing experience. Therefore hearing aid users should get
    used to the sound image from the instrument and learn how to interpret this.</p>
